# Cleaned Data

These files are created by running [climbing-clean-final.ipynb](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing/blob/master/src/climbing-clean-final.ipynb). Unfortunately, they are too big to host on github.

Please feel free to contact me if you require any assistance in creating these source files. The process will be:
1. Download source data. See [data/input/README.md](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing/blob/master/data/input/README.md) for additional details.
2. Convert the `sqlite` database to csv. Or modify `.ipynb` file to read the `sqlite` file.
3. Run the [climbing-clean-final.ipynb](https://github.com/m-dodd/rock-climbing/blob/master/src/climbing-clean-final.ipynb)

This will create the necessary csv files that the analysis notebook requires.
