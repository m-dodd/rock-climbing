# Cleaning and Analysis

As described elsewhere in this repo the original files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook) came as an `sqlite` database, which I converted to `csv` files for easier processing within `pandas` as I found they loaded faster.

I have all of my code that I used to clean and wrangle the data into the format I found worked best for anlysis in the ***cleaning*** notebook, which generates some clean `csvs` to work with in the ***analysis*** notebook.
